## Where things stand

- Branch: `master`, in sync with `origin/master`
  (github.com/mobin-ux/ApexDigitalAgency_Panel). Latest: `c3f7f2b`
  (flagship-phone responsive pass + safe-area/`dvh` + dev-server build-fix),
  on top of the gutter/breakpoint audit (`1d1252b`) and toolbar breadcrumb (`2ef57b5`).
- Working tree: `prisma/dev.db` modified (local test data — never commit),
  `graphify-out/` untracked (generated — never commit).
- Stale branch `refactor/apex-dashboard` (local + origin) is superseded by master;
  deletable, but ask the user first.

## Done (implemented, verified, pushed)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `cbd1ff7` | Foundation: brand tokens, sidenav cleanup, useCurrency, app.config |
| `d7793d5` | Auth fixes (reload-logout: useRequestFetch + swr:false), postinstall prisma generate, de-duplication |
| `51f1295` → `ee2b2cc` | Home/Balance page (interim rebuild, then Apex Design redesign + Yellix/violet token switch) |
| `ad12c8b` | New Order wizard (`services.vue`): 5 steps, financing calculator, e-signature, creates real orders |
| `4c1dc3d` | My Orders (`orders.vue`): list+detail, payment-plan rail, segmented installments; `/api/orders` now includes manager |
| `10001f1` | Wallet & Credit (`wallet.vue`): 4 tabs (Overview/Transactions/Installments/Banking) + top-up & apply-credit modals. Wired to `/api/finance/dashboard` (balance/cards), `/api/finance/transactions`, `/api/orders` (installments derived per ADR-010), real top-up via `POST /api/finance/deposit`. GBP throughout. Credit-line figures/auto-pay/invoices/bank details are TODO(api) placeholders. |
| `67512ce` | Support (`support.vue`): 3 tabs (My tickets split-pane inbox+thread / New request / Help & FAQ). Wired to `/api/support/tickets` (list), `/api/support/[id]/messages` (full thread, fetched per-ticket), `/api/support/[id]/reply`, `/api/support/create`; project dropdown from `/api/orders`. Status/category/priority are free-text schema fields normalized via keyword matching (`catKey`/`priKey`/`statusKey`). Attachments (no upload endpoint/model), assigned-agent identity (no assignee field — renders as generic "Apex Support"), and FAQ copy are TODO(api)/static placeholders. |
| `2ef57b5` | Toolbar: breadcrumb nav + dividers added to the shared page header (`DemoToolbar.vue`). |
| _(prior session)_ | **Cross-cutting responsive audit**: fixed a shell-level bug where `sidenav.vue` padded only the toolbar, not `<slot />` — every page's content had zero guaranteed horizontal gutter and ran edge-to-edge below ~1200px width. Nested `<slot />` inside the toolbar's padded wrapper (one fix, every page inherits it). Also: wallet.vue Transactions-tab filter pills now scroll instead of wrapping into a two-row oval; services.vue success-modal footer buttons stack on narrow phones instead of cramming side-by-side. Full breakpoint audit against the user's checklist (containers, grids, typography, touch targets, overflow) across balance/orders/services/support/wallet — see DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §5 "Fixed" for the write-up. settings.vue/auth pages explicitly excluded (user confirmed) — still old-style, in scope only when their design zip arrives. |
| `c3f7f2b` | **Flagship-phone responsive pass**: safe-area/`dvh` handling (`viewport-fit=cover`, shell gutters `max(<gutter>, env(inset))`, support pane + wallet/services modals `100dvh - env(top/bottom)`); wallet installment rows reflow to two lines under `sm` (no overflow at 393px); top-up presets `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4`; DemoToolbar gains a `md:hidden` search icon (search had no <768px entry) + `min-w-0`/`truncate` breadcrumb (drops parent crumb <400px), large duplicate page-title removed. **Build-fix**: a literal `pt-[env(...)]` in a sidenav comment was scanned by Tailwind v4 → invalid `padding-top: env(...)` → lightningcss 500'd the whole dev server (Tailwind scans comments; document classes in valid form or prose). Verified 1440px + 393px, no h-overflow, layouts revert at ≥sm. |
| _(this session)_ | **Admin backend foundation (ADR-013)**: shared server utils (`auth.ts` requireAuth/requireRole/requireAdmin + cookie/token single-source, `validate.ts` zod body/query → 400 fieldErrors, `http.ts` pagination envelope, `audit.ts` + new `AuditLog` Prisma model); `/api/admin/{users,users/:id,stats}` exemplar endpoints (RBAC w/ DB-fresh role, whitelisted PATCH + before/after audit); ~25 customer routes refactored off inline JWT + per-file PrismaClient onto the shared utils (bad token now 401 not 500). Security fixes en route: deleted unauthenticated `/api/users` GET/POST; ticket-thread IDOR (read+reply were fully unauthenticated); `/api/orders/pay` IDOR + atomic conditional debit; `settings/get-all` password-hash leak; login enumeration + token-in-body; deposit now increments `walletBalance` (column drifted before); signup wrote schema-invalid `role:'USER'`/`name`/`status`; seeds fixed + dev-gated (404 in prod); JWT secret via `NUXT_JWT_SECRET` runtimeConfig. Verified via curl matrix (403/401/400/audit) + browser login/reload smoke. |

## Wallet redesign — gotcha to remember

The design's modals use CSS `@keyframes` (apexPop/apexFade), **not** Vue enter/leave
transitions. My first pass wrapped each modal in `<Transition>` with opacity leave
classes — the leave animated to `opacity:0` but Vue **never unmounted the node**,
leaving an invisible full-screen overlay that swallowed all clicks (close handlers
"did nothing"). Fix: drop `<Transition>`, use plain `v-if` + the `.apex-fade`/`.apex-pop`
classes. If a future modal "won't close," suspect a stuck Transition-leave first.

## Remaining queue (user sends a Claude Design zip per page)  ⬅ Settings is NEXT

1. Settings (`settings.vue`)
2. Auth pages (login-1 = active login, signup-1, recover)
3. Not yet designed at all: service *compare* view, invoices, **admin panel UI**
   (its backend foundation — `/api/admin/**`, RBAC, audit — shipped via ADR-013;
   see REQUIREMENTS §6)

## Known issues (open, non-blocking)

- **Hydration mismatch warnings** on every dashboard page — pre-existing, shared
  chrome (suspect color-mode/i18n), NOT page regressions. Fix once, globally.
- Preview **screenshots time out** on this machine — verify via `preview_eval` DOM
  checks + computed styles; curl + cookie jar for SSR auth paths.
- **`claude-in-chrome` `resize_window` doesn't actually resize the viewport here** —
  reports success (and `window.resizeTo`/OS unmaximize-then-resize don't help either)
  but `window.innerWidth` never changes from whatever the Chrome window already was
  (~1528×651 observed). Screenshots always come back at that size regardless of the
  width/height requested. So mobile/tablet breakpoints can't be visually verified via
  this tool on this machine — rely on Tailwind class analysis (deterministic) + SSR
  DOM structure checks via curl; desktop-width rendering can still be screenshotted
  fine for sanity checks.
- Broken dev seeds: `/api/seed-rich`, `/api/seed-wallet`, `prisma/seed.js`
  (schema drift). Working: `create-admin`, `seed-orders`, `seed-support`, `seed-notifs`.
- `.npmrc` registry mirror (runflare) 403s intermittently →
  `pnpm install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com/`.
- Legacy pages (settings/auth) still old-style: hardcoded hex, USD,
  native alerts, Persian comments — normalize as each is redesigned.
- Prod-hardening backlog: httpOnly/secure cookie, real JWT_SECRET, gate seed
  endpoints (REQUIREMENTS §5).

## Open questions

- Backend for installments/credit-line/expenses/invoices (REQUIREMENTS §6) — build
  after the UI pass, or interleave? (User hasn't decided.)
- graphify knowledge graph: build was scoped (`.demo/app` + `.demo/server` +
  `layers/tairo`, code-only = free/local AST) but interrupted before extraction.
  Resume with `/graphify .` and re-select that scope if the user still wants it;
  partial artifacts sit in `graphify-out/`.

## Environment facts

- Dev login: `user@apex.com` / `user123` (customer), `admin@apex.com` / `admin123`
  — created by GET `/api/create-admin`.
- The user often runs their own dev server on **:3000**; agent preview uses
  `.claude/launch.json` (`demo`, autoPort) and must never kill the user's process.
- User-level auto-memory also exists at
  `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-mobin-Documents-apexpanel-ApexDigitalAgency-Panel/memory/`
  (project pointer, design decisions, spacing-fidelity feedback) — repo docs are the
  source of truth; keep both aligned on conflicts.

## How to resume in a fresh session

1. `CLAUDE.md` auto-loads (rules/conventions/commands).
2. Read this file for state; read `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §Roadmap for page status.
3. Deep-dive only as needed: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
   `docs/decisions/ADR-*` (esp. ADR-006 workflow, ADR-010 placeholders, ADR-011 math).
4. Continue the IN PROGRESS item above.
